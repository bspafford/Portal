# Portal
*A recursive rendering experiment in Unity URP*

This is a prototype of a recursive portal system built in Unity URP. Inspired by Valv'es *Portal*, it supports multiple portal layers using custom rendering logic. Created to explore camera rendering, oblique projection, and shader optimization.

- Real-time recursive portal rendering
- Oblique projection matrix manipulation
